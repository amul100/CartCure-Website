            </div>

            <h3>3.4 Compliance with Laws and Third-Party Terms</h3>
            <p>You represent and warrant that:</p>

            </ul>

            <h3>4.2 Staff Account Recommendation</h3>
            <p><strong>We strongly recommend creating a temporary staff account</strong> with limited permissions rather than sharing your primary administrator credentials. This enhances security and allows for easy access revocation upon project completion.</p>

            <h3>4.3 Password and Credential Handling</h3>
            <p>When you provide us with passwords or access credentials:</p>
            <ul>

                <li><strong>No Permanent Storage:</strong> We do not store passwords in long-term databases or file systems</li>
                <li><strong>Secure Transmission:</strong> Credentials are transmitted via encrypted HTTPS connections</li>
                <li><strong>Deletion Upon Completion:</strong> All access information is deleted within 24 hours of project completion</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>4.4 Your Security Responsibilities</h3>
            <div class="highlight-box">
                <p><strong>You are responsible for:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Changing all passwords immediately after service completion</li>
                    <li>Revoking staff account access when the project is complete</li>
                    <li>Using strong, unique passwords not used elsewhere</li>
                    <li>Enabling two-factor authentication on your accounts</li>
                    <li>Monitoring your account for unauthorized access</li>
                    <li>Notifying us immediately if you suspect a security breach</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>We are not liable for any unauthorized access resulting from your failure to change passwords or revoke access after service completion.</strong></p>

            <p>If delays are caused by your failure to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Provide timely responses or required information</li>
                <li>Grant necessary access to your store or systems</li>
                <li>Approve work or provide feedback within agreed timeframes</li>
